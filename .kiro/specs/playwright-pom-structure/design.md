# Design Document

## Overview

The Playwright POM Structure feature will create a comprehensive test automation project template that implements the Page Object Model pattern with Playwright. The design focuses on creating a scalable, maintainable, and easy-to-understand structure that follows industry best practices for test automation.

The solution will generate a complete project structure with working examples, proper configurations, and comprehensive documentation. Each component will be designed for reusability and extensibility, allowing teams to quickly adapt the structure to their specific testing needs.

## Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture pattern:

```
Application Layer (Tests)
    ↓
Page Object Layer (Pages & Components)
    ↓
Utility Layer (Helpers & Data)
    ↓
Configuration Layer (Playwright Config)
```

### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Tests, page objects, components, and utilities are clearly separated
2. **Reusability**: Components and utilities can be shared across multiple page objects and tests
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to UI elements only require updates in page objects, not tests
4. **Scalability**: Structure supports easy addition of new pages, components, and tests

## Components and Interfaces

### Page Objects

**Base Page Class Pattern**
```javascript
class BasePage {
  constructor(page) {
    this.page = page;
  }
  
  async waitForPageLoad() {
    // Common page loading logic
  }
  
  async takeScreenshot(name) {
    // Screenshot utility
  }
}
```

**Page Object Interface**
- Each page object extends BasePage
- Contains locators as class properties
- Implements action methods that return promises
- Includes validation methods for page state

### Component Objects

**Component Interface**
```javascript
class BaseComponent {
  constructor(page, rootSelector) {
    this.page = page;
    this.root = rootSelector;
  }
}
```

- Components are initialized with a root selector
- Can be embedded in multiple page objects
- Provide specific interaction methods for their UI elements

### Test Structure

**Test Organization**
- Each spec file corresponds to a page or feature
- Tests use describe/test blocks for organization
- Setup and teardown handled at appropriate levels
- Page objects instantiated in beforeEach hooks

### Utility Layer

**Data Management**
- User credentials and test data in separate files
- Environment-specific configurations
- Data generation utilities for dynamic test data

## Data Models

### User Credentials Model
```javascript
const testUsers = {
  validUser: {
    username: 'testuser@example.com',
    password: 'TestPass123!'
  },
  invalidUser: {
    username: 'invalid@example.com',
    password: 'wrongpass'
  }
};
```

### Page Object Data Structure
```javascript
class PageObject {
  constructor(page) {
    this.page = page;
    this.selectors = {
      // Element selectors
    };
  }
}
```

### Test Configuration Model
```javascript
const config = {
  testDir: './tests',
  timeout: 30000,
  use: {
    browserName: 'chromium',
    headless: true,
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure'
  }
};
```

## Error Handling

### Page Object Error Handling
- Implement timeout handling for element interactions
- Add retry logic for flaky elements
- Provide meaningful error messages with context
- Include screenshot capture on failures

### Test Error Handling
- Use try-catch blocks for complex test scenarios
- Implement proper test cleanup in finally blocks
- Add custom error messages for assertion failures
- Include debugging information in error logs

### Configuration Error Handling
- Validate environment variables and configurations
- Provide fallback values for optional settings
- Clear error messages for missing dependencies
- Graceful handling of browser launch failures

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Approach
- Page objects can be unit tested independently
- Mock Playwright page object for isolated testing
- Test utility functions separately from page interactions

### Integration Testing
- Test page objects with actual browser instances
- Verify component integration within pages
- Test cross-page navigation flows

### End-to-End Testing
- Full user journey testing using the page objects
- Multi-page workflows and complex scenarios
- Data-driven testing with various input combinations

### Test Data Strategy
- Separate test data from test logic
- Environment-specific test data configurations
- Dynamic data generation for unique test scenarios
- Cleanup strategies for test data persistence

## Implementation Considerations

### File Organization
- Clear naming conventions for all files
- Logical grouping of related functionality
- Easy navigation and discoverability
- Consistent code formatting and style

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient selector strategies (prefer data-testid)
- Minimize page object instantiation overhead
- Optimize wait strategies and timeouts
- Parallel test execution support

### Extensibility
- Easy addition of new page objects and components
- Plugin architecture for custom utilities
- Configuration override capabilities
- Template generation for new pages/tests

### Browser Compatibility
- Multi-browser support configuration
- Browser-specific handling where needed
- Responsive design testing capabilities
- Mobile browser testing support
