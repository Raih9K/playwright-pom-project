# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a complete Playwright test automation project structure using the Page Object Model (POM) pattern. The structure will provide a well-organized foundation for test automation projects with clear separation of concerns, reusable components, and maintainable test code. The implementation will include all necessary files, configurations, and example implementations to get users started with Playwright testing immediately.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want a standardized Playwright project structure with Page Object Model, so that I can quickly set up maintainable and scalable test automation projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project structure is created THEN the system SHALL generate a complete directory structure with pages/, tests/, utils/, and components/ folders
2. WHEN the structure is generated THEN the system SHALL include proper package.json with Playwright dependencies
3. WHEN the structure is created THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive playwright.config.js with standard configurations
4. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL include a detailed README.md with setup and usage instructions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a test developer, I want page object classes for common web pages, so that I can have reusable and maintainable page interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN page objects are created THEN the system SHALL provide home.page.js with selectors and methods for home page interactions
2. WHEN page objects are created THEN the system SHALL provide login.page.js with authentication-related selectors and methods
3. WHEN page objects are created THEN the system SHALL provide contact.page.js with form interaction methods
4. WHEN page objects are implemented THEN each SHALL follow consistent patterns for element selectors and action methods
5. WHEN page objects are created THEN they SHALL include proper error handling and waiting strategies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a test automation developer, I want reusable component classes, so that I can manage common UI elements that appear across multiple pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN component classes are created THEN the system SHALL provide header.component.js with navigation and header-specific methods
2. WHEN component classes are created THEN the system SHALL provide footer.component.js with footer-specific interactions
3. WHEN components are implemented THEN they SHALL be designed for reuse across multiple page objects
4. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL follow the same patterns as page objects for consistency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want example test specifications, so that I can understand how to write tests using the page object structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test specs are created THEN the system SHALL provide home.spec.js with example home page test cases
2. WHEN test specs are created THEN the system SHALL provide login.spec.js with authentication test scenarios
3. WHEN test specs are created THEN the system SHALL provide contact.spec.js with form submission test cases
4. WHEN test specs are implemented THEN they SHALL demonstrate proper use of page objects and components
5. WHEN test specs are created THEN they SHALL include both positive and negative test scenarios
6. WHEN tests are written THEN they SHALL follow Playwright best practices for test structure and assertions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want utility functions and test data management, so that I can maintain test data and helper functions in a centralized location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN utilities are created THEN the system SHALL provide userCredentials.js for managing test user data
2. WHEN utilities are implemented THEN they SHALL include functions for data generation and management
3. WHEN utility files are created THEN they SHALL be easily importable and reusable across test files
4. WHEN test data is managed THEN it SHALL support different environments (dev, staging, prod)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer setting up test automation, I want proper configuration and documentation, so that I can quickly understand and customize the project for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is created THEN the system SHALL provide playwright.config.js with browser configurations, test settings, and reporting options
2. WHEN documentation is created THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive README.md with setup instructions, usage examples, and project structure explanation
3. WHEN the project is configured THEN it SHALL support multiple browsers and execution modes
4. WHEN configuration is implemented THEN it SHALL include proper test reporting and screenshot capabilities
5. WHEN the project is documented THEN it SHALL include examples of how to extend and customize the structure
